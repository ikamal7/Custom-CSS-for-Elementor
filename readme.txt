This plugin helps you add custom CSS to any widget of Elementor.

== Description ==
The very 1st Elementor EXTENDER that will provide you more custom options for Elementor Widgets and make Elementor more user friendly without having any custom CSS knowledge. Its pre-written codes will do the tricks for you. Before you might need to write custom CSS to do such things, but now you wont! 

ðŸ’ This plugin will not add any new widget. Instead of that, this will enhance the current widgets of Elementor and Elementor Pro. 

ðŸ’ If you are not familiar with Custom CSS, but still you need some more features from Elementor widgets then this plugin is for you.
